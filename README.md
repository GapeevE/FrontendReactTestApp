# Phone Comparison SPA

This is a Single Page Application (SPA) built with React and TypeScript for comparing mobile phone specifications. The app allows users to:

## Available Scripts

* `npm start`

    Runs the app in development mode.
    Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

    The page will automatically reload when you make changes.
    You will see any lint errors in the console.

* `npm test`

    Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

* `npm run build`

    Builds the app for production to the build folder.
    It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

    The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
    Your app is ready to be deployed!

* `npm run eject`

    **Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!** 

    If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
